## Project Summary

This repository contains a **Dynamic Form Builder** application developed using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, and **Redux Toolkit**. The application enables users to:

- Create fully customizable dynamic forms with multiple field types and complex validation rules.
- Preview the form as it would appear to an end user, including real-time validation feedback.
- Save and manage multiple form configurations persistently using browser `localStorage`.
- Implement derived fields that calculate values based on other field inputs.

## Live Demonstration

A live deployment of the application is available at: [https://dynamic-form-builder-ivory.vercel.app/]

## Key Features

### Form Builder (`/create`)

- Support for multiple input field types: Text, Number, Email, Textarea, Select, Radio, Checkbox, and Date.
- Field configuration options include:
  - Custom labels, required toggles, and default values.
  - Validation rules such as mandatory inputs, length restrictions, email format verification, and custom password policies.
- Support for **Derived Fields**:
  - Define fields whose values are computed based on one or more parent fields.
  - Provide custom formulas or logic (e.g., calculating Age from Date of Birth).
- Intuitive interface to reorder or remove fields.
- Ability to save form schemas by specifying a form name; all data is stored in `localStorage` without backend dependencies.

### Form Preview (`/preview`)

- Interactive rendering of the constructed form.
- Real-time input validation with user-friendly error messages.
- Automatic updating of derived fields based on parent field changes.

### My Forms (`/myforms`)

- Displays a comprehensive list of all saved forms.
- Shows form metadata including name and creation date.
- Enables quick access to form previews.
